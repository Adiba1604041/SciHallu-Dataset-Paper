      "Abstract: Divided Government is nowadays a common feature of the US political system. The voters can cast partisan ballots for two political powers the executive (Presidential elections) and the legislative (the Congress election). Some recent studies have shown that many voters tend to shape their preferences for the political parties by choosing different parties in these two election contests. This type of behavior referred to by   as \"ticket splitting\" shows irrationality of behavior (such as preference reversal) from the perspective of traditional decision making theories (Von Neumann and Morgenstern (1953), Savage, (1954)). It has been shown by i.e. Zorn and Smith (2011) and also   that these types of 'non-separable' preferences are context dependent and can be well accommodated in a quantum like framework. In this paper we use data from   to show first of all probabilistic violation of classical (Kolmogorovian) framework. We proceed with the depiction of our observables (the Congress and the Presidential contexts) with the aid of the quantum probability formula that incorporates the 'contextuality' of the decision making process through the interference term. Statistical data induces the interference term of large magnitude exceeding one (hyperbolic interference). We perform with help of our transition probabilities a state reconstruction of the voters state vectors to test for the applicability of the generalized Born rule. This state can be mathematically represented in the generalized Hilbert space based on hyper-complex numbers.\n"

      "Section 1: Introduction\n",
      "  Paragraph 1: The application of the quantum models to phenomena outside the remit of quantum physics is not longer perceived as something exotic despite the novelty of this interdisciplinary field. The quantum like models that actively pursue the mathematical framework and concepts of quantum physics to other social phenomena serve as an effective explanatory and descriptive instrument. The philosophy of the application at this stage bears an phenomenological character, without the claim that the social and cognitive systems are exhibiting quantum features ( i.e. that that human brain is a huge quantum system where neurons act like quantum particles). The domain of applications includes primarily decision making problems in economics and cognitive science 1 (Bruza et al., (2009), Busemeyer et al., (2006aBusemeyer et al., ( , 2006bBusemeyer et al., ( , 2007)), Franco et al. (2009), Haven and Khrennikov (2009), Photos and Busemeyer (2009), Lambert-Mogilansky and Busemeyer (2012), Asano et al., (2012)). Other applications to decision theory and expected utility violations are by La Mura (2006), Danilov and Lambert Mogiliansky (2006) and Shubik (1999). Many contributions were also achieved in the domain of financial instrument modelling and game theory by Haven (2005Haven ( , 2006)), Segal and Segal (1998), and Eisert et al., (1999)) see also Aerts and Durt (1994) and Aerts and Sozzo (2011) for contributions in logic and categorization. These and many other findings are successfully reviewed in the books of Busemeyer and Bruza (2012) and Haven and Khrennikov (2013).\n",

      "  Paragraph 2: A new domain of application is the political science field with first discussions of possibility to model voters' preferences in a quantum framework by Zorn and Smith (2011) and a dynamical representation of the evolution of voters' preferences, including the impact of the so called election campaign \"bath\", by Khrennikova et al., (2014). Zorn and Smith (2011) fostered for the motivation of the interdisciplinary application of quantum framework: Among all of the academic specialties customarily identified as social sciences, political science is perhaps the greatest \"debtor\" discipline, in the sense that so many of the theories and methods and models put to the task of understanding politics are borrowed from scholars working in other fields. (Zorn and Smith, (2011), p.83) In this regard it seemed to be natural to search for inspiration and explanatory power in the domain of quantum physical models and their generalizations. (In this paper we shall consider a generalized quantum model obtained via extension of complex numbers to the hyper-complex algebra.)\n",

      "Section 2: U.S. Political system and the non-separability phenomenon\n",
      "  Paragraph 1: The US political system has a governance structure based on divided partisan control formed by the so called executive power attributed to the President of the U.S. and the legislative power formed by the Congress of the U.S. 2 . Moreover, two parties historically dominated the political arena: the Democrats and the Republicans. For that reason the U.S. has an established two party political system.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Paragraph 2: Historically, the voters used to hold stable preferences by supporting the same political party in both the White House and (at least one) Houses of Congress elections. In this regard a large body of orthodox studies on voting preferences perceived such power accumulation as a matter of fact and argued that the divided government should be perceived as a negative occurrence that rather inhibits the normal functioning of the political system (Cutler (1980), McCubbins (1991) Alvarez and Schousen (1993) and others). Zorn and Smith (2011) put forward that voters who strive to maximize their returns in terms of the political power would naturally choose the same party in both types of elections. These types of preferences would be consistent with the postulates of modern decision theories (e.g. Von Neumann and Morgenstern (1953) and Savage (1954)) implying completeness and invariance of the choice alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "  Paragraph 3: However, during the last 40 years the situation with power distribution started to change, in particular after the Watergate scandal related to the presidency of Richard Nixon. 3 The US voters started to search to separate the power as to balance the political decisions. 4 First attention to this phenomenon was paid by Morris Fiorina (1981Fiorina ( ,1996) ) who explained this behavior of voters not as a random occurrence, but as a purposive (but not necessarily conscious) motivation to balance the political power as to sustain a less extreme political course (in either direction). A recent study by Smith et al. (1999) showed that the voters are highly influenced by the upcoming information concerning the outcomes of the Presidential elections. In particular the voters strongly relate the outcomes of the Presidential elections to their subsequent decisions making. In fact they often change their preferences in favor of an opposition party for the Congress elections based on the obtained information. This phenomenon called by Smith et al. (1999) \"non-separability\" of preferences implies that a particular informational context affects the \"mental state\" of the voters in a way that is incompatible with their previous beliefs. More than a half of the respondents in the study by Smith et al (1999) exhibited a \"non-separability\" of preferences, where the new informational context strongly changed the point of view of the participants. The impact of the new information is especially appearing in the considerable amount of participants that elicited their preferences from uncertainty/ignorance (the answer' don't know) to firm preferences in favor of a particular party in the Congress elections. With line with the psychological studies in decision theory by Kahneman and Tversky (2003) we can witness that the all-inclusive context implying a stability of preferences is not preserved.\n",

      "  Paragraph 2: The first endeavor to incorporate the phenomenon of non-separability was done through a static representation of the choice outcomes in a one dimensional Euclidian space (see Fiorina (1996) and Smith et al. (1999)). However, as pointed out by Zorn and Smith (2011) the simplicity of this model entailed some limitations such as a lack of dynamical representation of the decision maker's state evolution as well as no account has been made for additional (contextual) factors impacting the preference emergence, i.e. the upcoming information and the mental characteristics of the voter. For this reason a Hilbert space representation of the observables (the party preferences) was proposed by depicting the superposition of the initial mental state of the voter. The final state decoherence into the particular eigenvectors is context depended, where a dynamical simulation that also accounted for the impact of the environmental context (the election campaign \"bath\") was proposed by Khrennikova et al. (2014).\n",

      "  Paragraph 3: This paper builds on the findings by Khrennikova et al (2014) by showing a violation of classical probabilistic updating of voters beliefs that yields in the violation of the Law of total Probability (Kolmogorov, 1933). We show that the voters' decision probabilities for the decision outcomes exhibit non-additivity, which can be captured through the quantum probability formula (Von Neumann, (1933)). The interference term in this formula accounts for the non-classicality of the observables (we cannot represent them in the classical probability space). We prove that we can apply Born rule by reconstructing the superposition state for our observables from the obtained eigenvalues and the transition probabilities. Furthermore, we obtain such a large magnitude of (called by Khrennikov (2010) \"hyperbolic\") interference for one of our eigenvectors that constrains a complex number Hilbert space representation of the observables, instead we propose for a hyperbolic Hilbert space state representation.\n",

      "\n",
      "  Paragraph 8: The contexts for Dole and Clinton are denoted by P {R, D} = 𝜆 {R, D, N). Thus we have a baseline context and two conditional observational contexts (Dole/ Clinton) that all can yield three outcomes: republican, democratic and don't' know. We decided to include the participants who were uncertain 6 as well, since the amount of these participants is substantial in the baseline context (as we see from the table 1  According to De Finetti (1972) the Law of total Probability and the notion of conditional probabilities were applied as the core inputs the of modern decision theory ( in economics and other fields) throughout the 20th Century. The Law of total Probability that is derived with the aid of Bayesian conditional probabilities (see Kolmogorov, (1933)), as is manifest by its name, denotes the total probability of an outcome given its fulfillment through different distinct events. The formula of the Law of total Probability obeys the principle of additivity and enables to express the occurrence of an outcome (p(C=𝜆)) through conditional probabilities (p(C=𝜆|P=D), p(C=𝜆|𝑃 = 𝑅) and the marginal probabilities given by p(P=D) and p(P=R). The (P=D) and (P=R) are disjoint events, (P=D) ∩ (P=R) =∅. It should be denoted that the probabilities applied for statistical decision making (on the right hand of the formula of Total Probability) could be as well objective probabilities, calculated on the basis of the previous statistical experience 8 (e.g. tossing of a coin) as well as subjective probabilities, based on one's personal experience/ beliefs. Both of them are interpretations of the Bayesian probabilities. In our study we deal with subjective formation of voters preferences, whereas the marginal probabilities encoded in the informational contexts are objective probabilities. Since we have the same amount of study participants (N= 983) in our Dole/ Clinton contexts we treat them as being equal, p(P=D)= p(P=R)= 0.5. By inserting our frequencies into the Law of total Probability we calculate the baseline probabilities (C=R, C=D and C=N) and examine if they correspond with the obtained results from the baseline context.\n",

      "  Paragraph 2: We obtained violation of the additivity of the conditional probabilities that compose all the baseline outcomes' probabilities. This violation is due to the preference reversal that occurs in the different informational contexts, which changes the mental state of the participants, especially in the 'don't know' outcome. This probabilistic error is well known through the works by Tversky and Shafir (1992) and Croson (1999), when the disjunction of two conditional events is judged as being lower or higher as the compound outcome. We suggest that our observational contexts exhibit non-classicality from the point of view of traditional probability theory and a different state space representation would be necessary to accommodate our observables and their impact on the decision makers' mental states. We proceed with incorporating our probability outcomes in a generalized Law of total Probability, the quantum probability formula that captures the interference of the complex probability amplitudes of the different decision outcomes that are manifest in the superposition state (represented as a state vector). The representation of the observables with help of quantum probability formula is of particular relevance to the field of political science since the so-called \" swing voters\" that are still in a superposition of various decisions are of particular attention in each US election campaign.\n",

In this regard a large body of orthodox studies on voting preferences perceived such power accumulation as a matter of fact and argued that the divided government should be perceived as a negative occurrence that rather inhibits the normal functioning of the political system (Cutler (1980), McCubbins (1991) Alvarez and Schousen (1993) and others). Zorn and Smith (2011) put forward that voters who strive to maximize their returns in terms of the political power would naturally choose the same party in both types of elections. These types of preferences would be consistent with the postulates of modern decision theories (e.g. Von Neumann and Morgenstern (1953) and Savage (1954)) implying completeness and invariance of the choice alternatives.\n",

      "  Paragraph 3: However, during the last 40 years the situation with power distribution started to change, in particular after the Watergate scandal related to the presidency of Richard Nixon. 3 The US voters started to search to separate the power as to balance the political decisions. 4 First attention to this phenomenon was paid by Morris Fiorina (1981Fiorina ( ,1996) ) who explained this behavior of voters not as a random occurrence, but as a purposive (but not necessarily conscious) motivation to balance the political power as to sustain a less extreme political course (in either direction). A recent study by Smith et al. (1999) showed that the voters are highly influenced by the upcoming information concerning the outcomes of the Presidential elections. In particular the voters strongly relate the outcomes of the Presidential elections to their subsequent decisions making. In fact they often change their preferences in favor of an opposition party for the Congress elections based on the obtained information. This phenomenon called by Smith et al. (1999) \"non-separability\" of preferences implies that a particular informational context affects the \"mental state\" of the voters in a way that is incompatible with their previous beliefs. More than a half of the respondents in the study by Smith et al (1999) exhibited a \"non-separability\" of preferences, where the new informational context strongly changed the point of view of the participants. The impact of the new information is especially appearing in the considerable amount of participants that elicited their preferences from uncertainty/ignorance (the answer' don't know) to firm preferences in favor of a particular party in the Congress elections. With line with the psychological studies in decision theory by Kahneman and Tversky (2003) we can witness that the all-inclusive context implying a stability of preferences is not preserved.\n",

(1999)). However, as pointed out by Zorn and Smith (2011) the simplicity of this model entailed some limitations such as a lack of dynamical representation of the decision maker's state evolution as well as no account has been made for additional (contextual) factors impacting the preference emergence, i.e. the upcoming information and the mental characteristics of the voter. For this reason a Hilbert space representation of the observables (the party preferences) was proposed by depicting the superposition of the initial mental state of the voter. The final state decoherence into the particular eigenvectors is context depended, where a dynamical simulation that also accounted for the impact of the environmental context (the election campaign \"bath\") was proposed by Khrennikova et al.

We show that the voters' decision probabilities for the decision outcomes exhibit non-additivity, which can be captured through the quantum probability formula (Von Neumann, (1933)). The interference term in this formula accounts for the non-classicality of the observables (we cannot represent them in the classical probability space). We prove that we can apply Born rule by reconstructing the superposition state for our observables from the obtained eigenvalues and the transition probabilities. Furthermore, we obtain such a large magnitude of (called by Khrennikov (2010) \"hyperbolic\") interference for one of our eigenvectors that constrains a complex number Hilbert space representation of the observables, instead we propose for a hyperbolic Hilbert space state representation.\n",

Thus we have a baseline context and two conditional observational contexts (Dole/ Clinton) that all can yield three outcomes: republican, democratic and don't' know. We decided to include the participants who were uncertain 6 as well, since the amount of these participants is substantial in the baseline context (as we see from the table 1  According to De Finetti (1972) the Law of total Probability and the notion of conditional probabilities were applied as the core inputs the of modern decision theory ( in economics and other fields) throughout the 20th Century. The Law of total Probability that is derived with the aid of Bayesian conditional probabilities (see Kolmogorov, (1933)), as is manifest by its name, denotes the total probability of an outcome given its fulfillment through different distinct events. The formula of the Law of total Probability obeys the principle of additivity and enables to express the occurrence of an outcome (p(C=𝜆)) through conditional probabilities (p(C=𝜆|P=D), p(C=𝜆|𝑃 = 𝑅) and the marginal probabilities given by p(P=D) and p(P=R). The (P=D) and (P=R) are disjoint events, (P=D) ∩ (P=R) =∅. It should be denoted that the probabilities applied for statistical decision making (on the right hand of the formula of Total Probability) could be as well objective probabilities, calculated on the basis of the previous statistical experience 8 (e.g. tossing of a coin) as well as subjective probabilities, based on one's personal experience/ beliefs. Both of them are interpretations of the Bayesian probabilities. In our study we deal with subjective formation of voters preferences, whereas the marginal probabilities encoded in the informational contexts are objective probabilities. Since we have the same amount of study participants (N= 983) in our Dole/ Clinton contexts we treat them as being equal, p(P=D)= p(P=R)= 0.5. By inserting our frequencies into the Law of total Probability we calculate the baseline probabilities (C=R, C=D and C=N) and examine if they correspond with the obtained results from the baseline context.\n",

This probabilistic error is well known through the works by Tversky and Shafir (1992) and Croson (1999), when the disjunction of two conditional events is judged as being lower or higher as the compound outcome. We suggest that our observational contexts exhibit non-classicality from the point of view of traditional probability theory and a different state space representation would be necessary to accommodate our observables and their impact on the decision makers' mental states. We proceed with incorporating our probability outcomes in a generalized Law of total Probability, the quantum probability formula that captures the interference of the complex probability amplitudes of the different decision outcomes that are manifest in the superposition state (represented as a state vector). The representation of the observables with help of quantum probability formula is of particular relevance to the field of political science since the so-called \" swing voters\" that are still in a superposition of various decisions are of particular attention in each US election campaign.\n",

Zorn and Smith (2011) put forward that voters who strive to maximize their returns in terms of the political power would naturally choose the same party in both types of elections. These types of preferences would be consistent with the postulates of modern decision theories (e.g. Von Neumann and Morgenstern (1953) and Savage (1954)) implying completeness and invariance of the choice alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Paragraph 3: However, during the last 40 years the situation with power distribution started to change, in particular after the Watergate scandal related to the presidency of Richard Nixon. 3 The US voters started to search to separate the power as to balance the political decisions. 4 First attention to this phenomenon was paid by Morris Fiorina (1981Fiorina ( ,1996) ) who explained this behavior of voters not as a random occurrence, but as a purposive (but not necessarily conscious) motivation to balance the political power as to sustain a less extreme political course (in either direction). A recent study by Smith et al. (1999) showed that the voters are highly influenced by the upcoming information concerning the outcomes of the Presidential elections. In particular the voters strongly relate the outcomes of the Presidential elections to their subsequent decisions making. In fact they often change their preferences in favor of an opposition party for the Congress elections based on the obtained information. This phenomenon called by Smith et al. (1999) \"non-separability\" of preferences implies that a particular informational context affects the \"mental state\" of the voters in a way that is incompatible with their previous beliefs. More than a half of the respondents in the study by Smith et al (1999) exhibited a \"non-separability\" of preferences, where the new informational context strongly changed the point of view of the participants. The impact of the new information is especially appearing in the considerable amount of participants that elicited their preferences from uncertainty/ignorance (the answer' don't know) to firm preferences in favor of a particular party in the Congress elections. With line with the psychological studies in decision theory by Kahneman and Tversky (2003) we can witness that the all-inclusive context implying a stability of preferences is not preserved.\n",

      "Section 3: Non-Separability in Quantum framework.\n",
      "  Paragraph 1: The first endeavor to incorporate the phenomenon of non-separability was done through a static representation of the choice outcomes in a one dimensional Euclidian space (see Fiorina (1996) and Smith et al. (1999)). However, as pointed out by Zorn and Smith (2011) the simplicity of this model entailed some limitations such as a lack of dynamical representation of the decision maker's state evolution as well as no account has been made for additional (contextual) factors impacting the preference emergence, i.e. the upcoming information and the mental characteristics of the voter. For this reason a Hilbert space representation of the observables (the party preferences) was proposed by depicting the superposition of the initial mental state of the voter. The final state decoherence into the particular eigenvectors is context depended, where a dynamical simulation that also accounted for the impact of the environmental context (the election campaign \"bath\") was proposed by Khrennikova et al. (2014).\n",

      "  Paragraph 2: This paper builds on the findings by Khrennikova et al (2014) by showing a violation of classical probabilistic updating of voters beliefs that yields in the violation of the Law of total Probability (Kolmogorov, 1933). We show that the voters' decision probabilities for the decision outcomes exhibit non-additivity, which can be captured through the quantum probability formula (Von Neumann, (1933)). The interference term in this formula accounts for the non-classicality of the observables (we cannot represent them in the classical probability space). We prove that we can apply Born rule by reconstructing the superposition state for our observables from the obtained eigenvalues and the transition probabilities. Furthermore, we obtain such a large magnitude of (called by Khrennikov (2010) \"hyperbolic\") interference for one of our eigenvectors that constrains a complex number Hilbert space representation of the observables, instead we propose for a hyperbolic Hilbert space state representation.\n",

(2009) that presented interview outcomes for 930 respondents 5 before the 1996 elections (with Bob Dole and Bill Clinton as presidential candidates).\n",
      "\n",
      "  Paragraph 2: The interview had a within group design and was performed in three stages (that we will call \"informational contexts\") to test for the occurrence of non-separability.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Paragraph 3: Firstly, a general question was asked to the respondents that sounded: \" Which party is the best choice for managing the U.S. Congress?\" (p.748) The aim of this question was to establish a baseline of the preferences, which subsequently would be compared to the conditioned responses shaped by the next questions. This question was embedded in a context of similar questions about partisan preferences, which assumingly was related to the elimination of order effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Paragraph 4: Secondly, the same respondents were contacted again and provided with following informational context:\n",
      "\n",
      "  Paragraph 5: \"If Bob Dole were to be elected President, which would you prefer: a Republican Congress to help him pass his agenda or a Democratic Congress to serve as a check on his agenda?\" (Smith et al (1999), p.747). Subsequently, the question was reverted to an opposite informational context (If Bill Clinton were to be elected president…) and posed to the same respondents.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Paragraph 6: We denote our baseline context as C = 𝜆 {R, D, N), corresponding choice outcomes: Democratic Congress, Republican Congress and 'don't know'.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Paragraph 7: The contexts for Dole and Clinton are denoted by P {R, D} = 𝜆 {R, D, N). Thus we have a baseline context and two conditional observational contexts (Dole/ Clinton) that all can yield three outcomes: republican, democratic and don't' know. We decided to include the participants who were uncertain 6 as well, since the amount of these participants is substantial in the baseline context (as we see from the table 1  According to De Finetti (1972) the Law of total Probability and the notion of conditional probabilities were applied as the core inputs the of modern decision theory ( in economics and other fields) throughout the 20th Century. The Law of total Probability that is derived with the aid of Bayesian conditional probabilities (see Kolmogorov, (1933)), as is manifest by its name, denotes the total probability of an outcome given its fulfillment through different distinct events. The formula of the Law of total Probability obeys the principle of additivity and enables to express the occurrence of an outcome (p(C=𝜆)) through conditional probabilities (p(C=𝜆|P=D), p(C=𝜆|𝑃 = 𝑅) and the marginal probabilities given by p(P=D) and p(P=R). The (P=D) and (P=R) are disjoint events, (P=D) ∩ (P=R) =∅. It should be denoted that the probabilities applied for statistical decision making (on the right hand of the formula of Total Probability) could be as well objective probabilities, calculated on the basis of the previous statistical experience 8 (e.g. tossing of a coin) as well as subjective probabilities, based on one's personal experience/ beliefs. Both of them are interpretations of the Bayesian probabilities. In our study we deal with subjective formation of voters preferences, whereas the marginal probabilities encoded in the informational contexts are objective probabilities. Since we have the same amount of study participants (N= 983) in our Dole/ Clinton contexts we treat them as being equal, p(P=D)= p(P=R)= 0.5. By inserting our frequencies into the Law of total Probability we calculate the baseline probabilities (C=R, C=D and C=N) and examine if they correspond with the obtained results from the baseline context.\n",

      "  Paragraph 2: We obtained violation of the additivity of the conditional probabilities that compose all the baseline outcomes' probabilities. This violation is due to the preference reversal that occurs in the different informational contexts, which changes the mental state of the participants, especially in the 'don't know' outcome. This probabilistic error is well known through the works by Tversky and Shafir (1992) and Croson (1999), when the disjunction of two conditional events is judged as being lower or higher as the compound outcome. We suggest that our observational contexts exhibit non-classicality from the point of view of traditional probability theory and a different state space representation would be necessary to accommodate our observables and their impact on the decision makers' mental states. We proceed with incorporating our probability outcomes in a generalized Law of total Probability, the quantum probability formula that captures the interference of the complex probability amplitudes of the different decision outcomes that are manifest in the superposition state (represented as a state vector). The representation of the observables with help of quantum probability formula is of particular relevance to the field of political science since the so-called \" swing voters\" that are still in a superposition of various decisions are of particular attention in each US election campaign.\n",

It has been shown that the voters do not only cast ballots for different parties, but even when doing it are highly impacted by the informational context, were the voters with no firm preferences form their opinions by conditioning them on the obtained information. We have shown nonclassicality of voters' behavior due to the incompatibility of the observational contexts that cannot be embedded into single classical probability space model.\n",

We propose for the representation of the observables that act upon the voters' cognitive states in hyper-complex three-dimensional Hilbert space. Thus our probabilistic representation is not only non-classical (i.e., non-Kolmogorovian), but can neither be described by canonical quantum formalism. Instead its generalization has to be applied.\n",
